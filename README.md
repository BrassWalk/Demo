For fun and demonstration

### Algorithms
These need polish still.

Need to document time and space complexity on each interface!

### Data Structures
##### ToDo
    Sign off on first version of Trie
    Completed Linked List and DoubleLinked List
    Refactor and Sign off on Cache
    
    Need to document time and space complexity on each interface!
    
    Need to add more data structures. Woulld be cool to eliminate standard library usage.
